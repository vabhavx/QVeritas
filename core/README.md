# Core - Deterministic Engine

## Overview

The Core module implements QVeritas's deterministic computation engine, ensuring reproducible execution across all platforms, architectures, and time periods. This is the foundational component that guarantees identical cryptographic results regardless of the execution environment.

## Phase 1 Implementation Goals

### Deterministic Execution Framework
- **Reproducible Operations**: Core mathematical operations with guaranteed identical results
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified behavior across Linux, macOS, Windows, and embedded systems
- **Memory Management**: Safe, deterministic memory allocation and deallocation patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error propagation and state management

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Deterministic Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure, reproducible PRNG
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Timing-attack resistant implementations
- **Modular Arithmetic**: High-precision integer operations for cryptographic calculations
- **Field Operations**: Finite field arithmetic for lattice-based cryptography

### Build System Integration
- **Reproducible Builds**: Identical binary outputs across different build environments
- **Rust-Based Implementation**: Memory-safe core with C FFI for legacy integration
- **Test Harness**: Comprehensive testing framework with formal verification hooks
- **Documentation**: Academic-grade documentation with implementation proofs
